While completing this assignment, I experimented with the different AI tools available within VSCode. For example, using the GPT-4 AI, I asked it to help me set up TailwindCSS within my project. Before this, I was having a hard time implementing it based on the directions given within the docs, however, after asking: "I'm installing tailwindcss to this project using CLI. I just ran the init command in my terminal which created the tailwind configuration js file. What's my next step?" The AI then responded with the export code I should have within my config file, as well as what to include in my original CSS file.

Another time I found Copilot useful was when using Alpine-fetch to fetch the json data I was looking for. Also using GPT-4, I asked: "The data I'm pulling from this api includes an "instruction" object, which is in the form of a list. However, when I pull this data, the list apears in a paragraph format. How can I have each item added to an unordered list at a time" The response I received taught me how to use ***template*** and ***x-for*** effectively to acheive my desired results.

Overall, I thought Copilot was helpful when I found myself stuck, especially because we were learning and practicing new things for this lab assignment.
